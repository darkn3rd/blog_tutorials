Generic Kubernetes 

This area is Kubernetes applications that could work across any implementation of Kubernetes.  There may be implementation specific examples that require tailoring things like storage, external load balancers, and ingress.

The idea for this is that this is a baseline, and the implementation specific examples will just source from this area with modifications going forward.
